# Collectors

The vNSFs gather data related to the environment that is victimg of a threat. A vNSF collector gathers this data and converts it into a format accepted by DARE; right before sending it to the processing cluster.

Each vNSF may implement any of the collectors here exposed. Installation and configuration instructions are distributed inside each collector.
